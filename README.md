# SPACE APPS CHALLENGE - San Francisco HACKATHON 2016

##Motivation/Challenge 

We are addressing radical transformations in data exploration and the impact of the third dimension for understanding complex earth-systems data. Currently the vast amounts of geospatial data are not being utilized as easily as we would imagine for solving major biogeochemical processes of the 21st century. Part of this is due to the fact that their is a major lack of creative api tools that maximize user interactivity and as a result the traditional data visualization experience is mundane, boring, and void of any fresh interpretation.

## Impact 

* Dynamic view of two-dimensional weather data
* Give flat weather data an extra dimension
* Open-source weather visualization tool for citizens, scientists, engineers, decision-makers, and anyone with an interest in understanding their planet. 

### Design Vision

Create a responsive web application that provides 3D displays of real-time spatial information at multiple scales where users can customize visualizations via multiple device types, data is projected from base maps and satellite imagery to connect data from a variety of api's and data sources.

### Methodology
1. Brainstormed reliable data sources
2. Acquired data using browser-server data requests to API
3. Built a data platform for reading geospatial data from different sources
4. Displayed imagery of 3-D graphic by rendering informati to the base maps
