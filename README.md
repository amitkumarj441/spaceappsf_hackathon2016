Motivation/Challenge 

We are addressing radical transformations in data exploration and the impact of the third dimension for understanding complex earth-systems data. Currently the vast amounts of geospatial data are not being utilized as easily as we would imagine for solving major biogeochemical processes of the 21st century. Part of this is due to the fact that their is a major lack of creative api tools that maximize user interactivity and as a result the traditional data visualization experience is mundane, boring, and void of any fresh interpretation.

Impact 
Dynamic view of two-dimensional weather data
Give flat weather data an extra dimension
Open-source weather visualization tool for citizens, scientists, engineers, decision-makers, and anyone with an interest in 
understanding their planet. 

Design Vision
Create a responsive web application that provides 3-D displays of real-time weather data at the city level for California, users can receive up-to-date weather information, data is projected from base maps and satellite imagery to provide an interactive experience.

Methodology
1. Brainstormed reliable data sources
2. Acquired data using browser-server data requests to API
3. Built a data platform for reading geospatial data from different sources
4. Displayed imagery of 3-D graphic by rendering informati to the base maps
